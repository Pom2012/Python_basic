    Difference Between Module and Package in Python
    In Python, both modules and packages organize and structure the code but serve different purposes.

    In simple terms, a module is a single file containing python code,
    whereas a package is a collection of modules that are organized in a directory hierarchy.

    Module: It can be a simple Python file (.py extensions) that contains collections of functions and global variables.
        Required Files: Only Python File(.py format)
        How to import: import module_name
        Example: math, random, os, datetime, csv
        Purpose: 	Code organization
    Package: A Package is a collection of different modules with an _init_.py file.
        Required Files: ‘_init_.py’ file and python files
        How to import: import package_name.module_name
         Example: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, django
         Purpose: Code distribution and reuse
